# Scientific Calculator 🧠🧮

This project is an advanced version of the simple calculator, developed in the first year of my B.Tech program. It extends basic operations with scientific functions like trigonometry, logarithms, and exponents.

The GUI is built using **Python's Tkinter library**, making it interactive and user-friendly for performing both basic and advanced mathematical calculations.
